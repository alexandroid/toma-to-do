This is a simple pomodoro timer ~~which can be used as a simple standalone Javascript application~~.

Live working version (uses local storage so it does not need a server):

Design of the flow:
1. Create a list of tasks for the day to work on.
2. Start working on tasks, using pomodoro - choose the task, start the timer.
3. Rest periods must follow work periods.
